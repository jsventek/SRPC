SRPC uses the GNU Autoconf system for configuration and building

To generate the configure script:
autoreconf -if

If autoreconf complains about libtool problems... run libtoolize first
libtoolize

After generating the configure script,
./configure --help
will list configuration options.

After successfully completing an execution of the configure script, Makefiles will be generated in the correct directories and make can be used to build and install the software.
make clean
make
make install
